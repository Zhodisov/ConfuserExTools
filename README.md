# ConfuserExTools
ConfuserEx unpacking tools

It has only basic support for ConfuserEx (AntiTamper, ReferenceProxy, Constants) because it is a tool for my personal use.

Whether it gets further update is based on whether I still need it.

NOTE: For constants decryption, it only supports non-cfg mode.

## Usage

Download latest [ToolLoader](https://github.com/wwh1004/ToolLoader/releases/latest/download/ToolLoader.zip) and decompress it into build artifacts folder.

Open cmd or powershell here and enter "**Tool.Loader.Auto.exe ConfuserExKiller.dll -f ***your_assembly_path*****"
